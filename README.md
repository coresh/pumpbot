# Pumpbot

This bot is used to snipe purchases off bittrex by using a command-line script and configuration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Nodejs (6.11.2 at least)
NPM (3.10.10 at least)

https://nodejs.org/en/download/
The LTS version of node will come with NPM, it should be all you need

Navigate to the directory with the pumpbot script in a commandline-prompt and run
```
npm install
```

### Get your API Keys
You should make sure get two api keys for this bot

One should have View-Only rights, and the other should be your live trading key.
You can follow [this](https://coinigy.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/1000087495-how-do-i-find-my-api-key-on-bittrex-com-) to get your api keys.

You have 2 options for using the api keys...
1. You can input it with the console each time you use the bot
```
node pumpbot.js -k YourAPIKey -s YourAPISecret <coin>
```
2. You can hardcode it into the application in config.js
```javascript
  // READ ONLY KEY
  api_key: '', // api key for bittrex API
  api_secret: '', // api secret for bittrex API
  // TRADE KEY
  // api_key: '',
  // api_secret: '',
```

Either option I highly recommend you make use of the API whitelist feature in bittrex

### Setting Up the Configuration

There are a few configurations that you will need to understand and change to satisfy your needs from the bot.
First copy config.example.js to config.js, then edit accordingly.

```
cp config.example.js config.js
```

```javascript
  investment_percentage: .5, //how much of your current bittrex wallet do you want to invest
  no_buy_threshold_percentage: .2, //fail the buy if this percentage threshold has passed
  no_buy_threshold_time: 3, //time history (in minutes, max 10) to fail the buy if threshold is passed
  market_buy_inflation: .15, //set the market buy to currentPrice + inflation percentage
  disable_prompt: false, //bypass the 'are you sure?' before submitting the buy
  auto_sell: true, //automatically sell when the desired_return is triggered
  desired_return: .2, //percentage return expected when initiating a sell
  flat_limits: false, // desired_return and the stop loss figures use BTC price, not percentage
  include_fees: true, // include bittrex fees when calculating returns
  fake_buy: true, //fake buy call to test the flow of the application
```
**Any percentage configuration is set with decimals (i.e. .1 = 10%, .2 = 20% etc). If you set these using whole numbers, it will consider them over 100%**

**If using flat_limits, be very careful. There is some intelligence put in to prevent you from placing an order that will immediately exit, but the bot is not idiot-proof.**

**IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE CONFIGURATION OPTIONS DO BEFORE USING THE BOT FOR LIVE TRADES**
**IF YOU ARE UNSURE OF A SETTING, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TEST IT WITH A LIVE TRADE**

## Running the Bot

Navigate to the directory with the bot script in a commandline prompt
```
node pumpbot.js
```

This outputs the command options:

```
Usage: node pumpBot.js <coin> [options]

Options: (options override config.js)

  -k <api_key>         API Key
  -s <api_secret>      API Secret
  -f <filename>        Specify an alternative configuration file (defaults to config.js)
  -h <desired_return>  Desired exit percentage in decimal format (e.g. 0.2 for 20%)
  -l <stop_loss>       Desired stop loss percentage in decimal format (e.g. 0.2 for 20%)
  -b                   Desired_return / Stop_loss are BTC prices, not percentage (e.g. 0.00025125)
  -y                   Skip the buy confirmation prompt and buy immediately
  --help               Display this message

Example Usage:

Buy VTC using a config file named 'config.trading.js' and sell when 20% gain reached, or when loss is 5%:

  node pumpBot.js vtc -f trading -h 0.2 -l 0.05

Buy XVG using a config file named 'config.bitcoin.js' and sell when 0.00000075 price reached, or when price is below 0.00000065:

  node pumpBot.js xvg -f trading -b -h 0.00000075 -l 0.00000065

Buy Bitbean with no stop loss and no confirmation prompt, only selling when 150% gains are reached:

  node pumpBot.js -h 1.5 -y bitb
```

Build out a command based on the options. Notably:
* The -h parameter optionally overrides the desired_return configuration item.
* The -l parameter optionally sets a stop loss in percent form
* The -b parameter uses bitcoin price instead of percentage for the previous two options

**Note: Be careful using the stop loss feature as it may be overly sensitive**

### Testing the Bot
To test the bot and perform a fake trade, you should make sure a few configuration settings are set

```
fake_buy: true
```
This will ensure that a live trade will not be made, it will make a fake trade at market value.

Make sure you have the api key using your View-Only key and not the Trade key

```javascript
  // READ ONLY KEY
  api_key: '', // api key for bittrex API
  api_secret: '', // api secret for bittrex API
  // TRADE KEY
  // api_key: '',
  // api_secret: '',
```
### Making a Live Trade

To use the bot in a live setting, make sure a few configuration settings are set

```
fake_buy: false
```
This will instruct the bot to make a live trade on bittrex


Make sure you have the api key using your Trade key

```javascript
  // READ ONLY KEY
  //api_key: '', // api key for bittrex API
  //api_secret: '', // api secret for bittrex API
  // TRADE KEY
  api_key: '',
  api_secret: '',
```
When you run this script and tell the bot to purchase a coin, it will make a live trade on bittrex.

### Selling
This bot can be configured to automatically sell after your purchase has been made
```
  auto_sell: true, //automatically sell when the desired_return is triggered
  desired_return: .5, //percentage return expected when initiating a sell
```
After the buy, the bot will monitor for updates in the price until a profit of the desired_return is hit. If it does not hit this point, it will not sell.
I would not recommend relying on the selling mechanism of this bot. I recommend you set the auto_sell and the desired_return to a reasonable amount and then rely on manually selling your position on bittrex
